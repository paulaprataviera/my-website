      <h2> ABOUT </h2>
      <p> hello, world! <br><br> my name is <span style="color: #88c9ea">paula prataviera</span>
        and I was born in Brazil but I am currently living in Amsterdam.
        <br> this is my first web project, conceived while studying the basics of HTML,
        CSS and JavaScript.
        <br><br>moving to a new country was incredibly important for me to re-evaluate my
        personal and professional journey so far - it gave me the opportunity to build up the
        courage to work very hard and develop the technical skills I always wanted to, but kept postponing for no good reason.
        <br><br>it's been almost 10 years since I decided to join the advertising and communication industry,
        and I've been on the client-facing side of the table every single time,
        but now I find myself more and more excited to learn about front and back-end development as well.
        <br>

      <h2> WORK </h2>
      <p>I still don't have any technical work to showcase - other than this fabulous website : )
        but stay tunned as I plan to fill in this section during the next few months.
        <br><br> meanwhile, I can tell you that I have worked with some great people from
        around the globe and amazing international brands, like <span style="color: #88c9ea">Intel, Google and Unilever</span>.
        these experiences helped me become a more empathic, flexible and collaborative human being.
        <br> <br>
        now my plan is to constantly try to become a better version of myself - and having fun while doing it. <br> </p>
